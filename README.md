# 👋 Hello App – My First PyQt6 Application

This is a simple desktop GUI app built using **Python** and **PyQt6**. It's my first project to explore building graphical user interfaces. The app features a basic window with interactive elements and is packaged with a setup file for easy distribution.

👋 I’m excited to share that I’ve built my first desktop application using PyQt6 and Python!

🙃 This simple project taught me the basics of GUI development, such as creating windows, buttons, and handling events. I also learned how to generate a setup file for easy installation on other systems. 

This marks the start of my journey with Python GUI development using PyQt6 🔥. 

💖 Thank you, Code In Place! 😍
